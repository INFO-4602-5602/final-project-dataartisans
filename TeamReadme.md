<h2>Information About Visualizations:</h2>

The team really poured their heart into this final project physical visualization. We set out to build a large-scale, 3D bar chart / international tactile map which offered the user various interaction elements. The data was based on the 2017 World Happiness Report, published by the UN. We gave the user an opportunity to view the happiness index of 157 nations, measured and displayed statically in 3D bar charts surrounding the map. Measures of other primary features from the data (trust in government, life expectancy, generosity, GDP, family, freedom) are coded into the LED lights when those attributes are selected (via buttons), and are represented by a color scale. Regions of the world can be enabled or disabled by pressing on the regions themselves. 

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
The team worked tirelessly to see the design completed by Sunday, 5/7/17. We learned a lot through the process of interacting with the data, as we constructed the vis and tested out the data representations via the LEDs. Some of our findings can be seen in the explanatory video (others are in the overview paper). It certainly wasn't an easy end-of-the-semester task; but the reward of seeing other students or people in ATLAS engaging with the design as they pass through the building, and the joy of interacting with our own hand-built design, was well worth the effort.
