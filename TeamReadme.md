<h2>Information About Visualizations:</h2>

The team really poured their heart into this final project physical visualization. We set out to build a large-scale, 3D bar chart / international tactile map which offered the user various interaction elements. The data was based on the 2017 World Happiness Report, published by the UN. We gave the user an opportunity to view the happiness index of 155 nations, measured and displayed statically in 3D bar charts surrounding the map. Measures of other primary features from the data (trust in government, life expentancy, generosity) are coded into the LED lights, and are represented by differnet colors and degrees of luminance. Regions of the world can be enabled or disabled by pressing on the regions themselves. 

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
The tean  worked tirelessly to see the design completed by Sunday, 5/7/17. We learned a lot through the process of interacting with the data, as we contructed the vis and tested out the data representations via the LEDs. It certainly wasn't an easy end-of-the-semester task; but the reward of seeing other students or people in ATLAS engaging with the design as they pass through the building, and the joy of interacting with our own, hand-built design, was well worth the effort.
